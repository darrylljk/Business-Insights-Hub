# Adventure Works' Business Insights Hub

## Project Overview
### Motivation
This is a personal project of mine centering around data analysis and visualization with Power BI and Power Query. I built the Business Insights Hub as a demo for real-world companies to showcase how they can leverage data-driven insights in an all-in-one platform to improve business performance, optimize decision-making, and identify growth opportunities across key areas such as sales, customer behavior, and product trends.

### About the Business Insights Hub
The Business Insights Hub is an enterprise-grade analytics platform, offering insights into various facets of Adventure Works' business using sales data. This platform serves as a one-stop shop for data analysis across key areas, including sales performance, customer segments, product trends, purchasing patterns, and reseller performance.

Platform highlights include demand forecasting, RFM customer segmentation analysis, executive sales report, sales and profitability by region, product trends, seasonal patterns, and reseller performance evaluation.

### Adventure Works
Adventure Works (AW) is a fictional company, created by Microsoft, that manufactures and sells bicycles, bicycle parts, and accessories along with other related products.

For this project, I am using `AdventureWorks Sales` dataset by Microsoft.

- applied first rows as headers
- scaled down scope to FY19 & FY20
- handled missing and duplicate values
- ensured consistency in data types
- inspected data quality and data distributions
- checked for outliers
- checked cardinality
- created measures and calculated columns for advanced analysis by writing DAX code
- appended "_" to measures and calculated columns to push to top for easy reading and access
- connected tables using star schema, dimension tables connected to fact tables in a one-to-many relationship
